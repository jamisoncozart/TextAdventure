  storyText: 'The guards recognize the symbol on your van and immediately open fire.
    They blow out your tires, preventing you from driving further. You struggle to
    unharness the pistol from your waist as the seatbelt is in the way, and before
    you can undo the clasp, a guard runs up to your window and blows your head off.
