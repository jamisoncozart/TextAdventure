After many hours of driving your payload of illegal data-chips across the plains, 
you have finally arrived in New San-Fran. You are low on gas, 
but it's likely you could make it to your destination without stopping.

What do you do?
1. Stop at the next gas station.
2. Push onward to deliver the payload.
